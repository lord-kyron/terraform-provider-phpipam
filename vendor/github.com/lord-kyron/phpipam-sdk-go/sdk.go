// Package sdk is a partial SDK for the PHPIPAM API.
//
// This is a WIP and this README along with the rest of the code will develop
// until it reaches an acceptable level of maturity that it can be used with
// some CLI tools that we are developing to work with PHPIPAM, and possibly a
// Terraform provider to help insert data gathered from AWS and beyond.
//
// For SDK usage, see the GoDoc at
// https://godoc.org/github.com/pavel-z1/phpipam-sdk-go.
